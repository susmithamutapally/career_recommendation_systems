## How It Works

1. **User Inputs**: Choose your interests, skills, and current education level.
2. **Role Generation**: An OpenAI model suggests a suitable starting role.
3. **Career Path Matching**: A pre-trained Hugging Face model computes embeddings for the starting role and compares it with a set of potential career options using cosine similarity.
4. **Top Career Matches**: The app recommends the most aligned next steps based on semantic similarity.
